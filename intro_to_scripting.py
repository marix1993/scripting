### Python scripting

# Easy to understand
# Many libraries
# Large community
# Large interoperability (Python can talk to other languages
# and software easily)

# Why do we care about scripting? (SLC software life cycle to make it as smooth as possible)
# (Automate repetitive manual tasks using code)

# Some examples that we can write script as DevOps

# Python to query a database (SQL)
# Write Py script to execute shell command
# Python to create a backup
# Python script to fetch I.P's addresses of autoscaling
# Python script to check the expiry date of an SSL certificate


### Seven in built modules that allow us to do some interesting things

# sys
# os
# subprocess
# random
# datetime
# json

## sys module
# import sys
#
# print(sys.version)  # version of python
#
## os module
# import os
#
# print(os.getcwd()) # gets our current directory
# os.chdir("C:/Users/Mateusz/PycharmProjects/pythonProject/pythonProject/") # change current directory
# print(os.getcwd())

# os.mkdir("new_dir") - making new folder
